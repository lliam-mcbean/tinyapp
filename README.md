## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cookie-session

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

## Summary 

Overall this was a good exercise in learning most of the prodominent features of express and server side Node.js.

EJS is a good language to be aware of and is i nice introduction into component based web frameworks.

Hashing is a rabbit hole I would love to go down when i have more time. I am really fascinated by how the algorithms are working under the hood (although it might be way over my head)

cookie sessions and working with user IDs to log people in was a completely new experience for me and I am really glad to understand the core principles.
